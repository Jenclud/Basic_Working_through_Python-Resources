### üìñ Resources

#### Data Analytics with Python

Data analytics is crucial for making informed decisions. In this section, you will find examples and tutorials that guide you through the process of analyzing data using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

#### Decorators in Python

Decorators allow you to modify the behavior of functions. You'll learn how to create your own decorators and apply them to enhance existing functions.

#### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way to store data. Explore how to create, access, and manipulate dictionaries effectively.

#### Error Handling

Learn how to handle errors using try-except blocks. This section covers common exceptions and how to manage them to ensure your code runs smoothly.

#### Functions

Functions are building blocks in Python. Discover how to define and call functions, as well as understand the scope of variables within them.

#### Identity Operators

Identity operators check if two variables point to the same object. You'll learn how to use `is` and `is not` effectively.

#### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements control the flow of your program. This section explains how to use if-elif-else statements to make decisions based on conditions.

#### Lists

Lists are versatile data structures. Learn how to create, access, and manipulate lists, including slicing and indexing techniques.

#### Loops

Loops allow you to iterate over data. This section covers for and while loops, along with practical examples.

#### Membership Operators

Membership operators check for the presence of an item in a data structure. Learn how to use `in` and `not in` to check for membership.

#### Nested Functions

Nested functions can access variables from their enclosing scope. Explore how to define and use nested functions in your code.

#### Nested If Statements

Complex logic often requires nested if statements. This section explains how to structure them for clarity and efficiency.

#### Nested Loops

Nested loops allow you to iterate through multi-dimensional data structures. Learn how to use them effectively with practical examples.

#### Sets

Sets are collections of unique items. Discover how to create and manipulate sets, along with common set operations.

#### Slicing and Indexing

Slicing and indexing are essential for data manipulation. This section covers how to access specific elements in lists, strings, and other data structures.

#### String Manipulation

String manipulation is key for data processing. Learn various techniques to modify and analyze strings in Python.

#### Tuples

Tuples are immutable sequences. Explore how to use tuples for fixed collections of items and their benefits over lists.

#### Type Casting

Type casting allows you to convert data types. This section covers common conversions and when to use them.

### üí° Tips for Effective Data Wrangling

1. **Understand Your Data**: Always start by exploring your data. Understand its structure, types, and any missing values.

2. **Keep It Simple**: Use straightforward methods for data cleaning and transformation. Complex solutions can lead to errors.

3. **Document Your Process**: Keep notes on your data wrangling steps. This helps in maintaining clarity and reproducibility.

4. **Use Version Control**: Keep track of changes using Git. This allows you to revert to previous versions if needed.

5. **Test Your Code**: Always test your functions and scripts to ensure they work as expected.

### üìÖ Upcoming Features

We plan to expand this repository with more advanced topics in data wrangling, including:

- Data visualization techniques
